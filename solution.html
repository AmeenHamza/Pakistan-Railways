          <h1>The Main Problem of Pakistan Railways and What is the Solution?</h1>
          <p class="">
            The railway is an essential part of the modern Pakistani economy, and its problems are widespread. Many governments have blamed the NLC for the problems, but there is no single reason for the ongoing losses.
          </p>

              <p class="fst-italic">
                There is also a huge pension bill and a lack of funding. Even if the government can privatize the department, it must ensure that it will deliver quality services to the public. The private sector has proven that it is capable of implementing quality management practices.
              </p>
            <p>The railways’ major income comes from freight services, and this segment is the most neglected. Unfortunately, the tracks are over-aged and the trains cannot maintain 120 km/h speeds in some sections. The quality of services is low, and passengers complain about the railway services. Though the quality management department claims to maintain standards, the Railways should benchmark itself against India or Japan to make sure that it meets international quality standards.

            <h3>Workspace</h3>
            <p>Another problem is the demoralization of the workforce. It is not a unique problem of Pakistan Railways; it is a widespread issue in all sectors of the economy. Employees at Pakistan Railways are lazy, bureaucratic, resistant to change, and earn low wages. They feel no sense of accountability, and this demotivation is directly related to the level of service delivery. The best and most efficient employees have to leave the service in order to stay afloat.</p>
            <p>The biggest problem is the lack of funds. The railways are in dire straits and cannot cope with the financial crisis. The company’s finances are in the red, and the employees are suffering. As a result, employees are losing their jobs and the public is losing trust in the railways. In the meantime, the country is facing a severe political crisis. What is the main problem of Pakistan Railways, and what is the solution?</p>
            <p>
                The Pakistan Railways are not financially sound. There are several problems with the quality of service. Its implementation of quality management is poor. Seventy percent of carriages are out of service. Locomotives are insufficient. The main issue is the lack of money. The railways have been ruined by political interference. The government’s leadership and the army generals control the entire country.
            </p>
            <h3>Political Interference in Railways</h3>
            <p>The new minister in charge of the railways has admitted that there is a serious crisis in the company. The implementation of quality management measures is not up to par. In some areas, there are even operational inefficiencies, but the management of the trains is inefficient. As a result, the train operators are failing to provide good service. The rail industry is in desperate need of restructuring. It has a deteriorating reputation.</p>
            <p>In addition to the track issues, the railways also face insufficient funds. The NLC was formed in 1978 and started using trucks to transport freight. This was a major blow for Pakistan Railways, as they have to depend on freight to earn their money.

            </p>
            <p>The main problem of the railways in Pakistan is that the government is not investing in its infrastructure. The railways have been a major problem for decades. The infrastructure has been neglected for decades. The rails are muddied, and there is no human resources management in the system.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                <b>WITH massive incompetence of the Pakistan Railways, it is publicly admitting now that it does not have fuel money for more than two days. The responsible person sitting at the top should resign immediately, as all trains will be shut with no work left for them. Instead, a sincere, honest and efficient team of professionals should be put in place for three years to bring immediate improvements to the Railways department.</b>
            </p>
                <p>The significance of a good train system is critical to the economy of the country which is based on a good affordable and an efficient railways infrastructure, including new engines, bogies, tracks and bridges.

                    One train engine can pull up to more than 500 bogies at more than 130 km/hour from Karachi to Khyber and back. Since the KPT /PQ port handles thousands of containers a day mostly going upcountry, they have to be moved up north for which 10 trains of a few hundred cargo bogies are required on a daily basis.
                    
                    Almost 10 trains from Khyber to Karachi carrying exportable goods back to the port daily may even have to cater to freight needs of other northern landlocked neighbour countries.
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>In fact, with some minor modification trains can carry complete trucks with their containers on them, and when they reach the nearest station, they can drive off them using a ramp, making freight trains and truck combination even more efficient.

                        This could become the best solution.
                        
                        The cost of cargo in train, as a general rule, is about one-fifth of the cost by truck, whose costs are one truck engine, two drivers and one container. So for a few hundred containers, a few hundred drivers are required for day and night, and a few hundred truck engines.
                        
                        In a train, however, there are four to five drivers while the size of one big engine is about eight to 10 truck engines, pulling a few hundred cargo containers at one time.
                        
                        If a truck charges Rs100,000 for a container as fare for a trip to Khyber from Karachi, it will be able to do the same fare in Rs20,000 for a container and that also profitably for railways, if done efficiently.
                        
                        Also, to add value to the railway income, the railways department should build large cold stores, milk chillers, fruit and vegetable wash plants, big warehouses and grain depots next to all major stations, especially near rural rail stations, to store perishable goods.
                        
                        This extra money can be put to good use to better pay all its railway employees and, secondly, to upgrade all its systems.
                        
                        The Railways’ land should be converted to do what the Bahria foundation is doing: in Bahria 1, 2, and 3, Karachi, where high quality office space has been built and rented to corporate customers.
                        
                        A solid Railways foundation should be built for the welfare of all retired railways employees, so that the employees of the Railways department work hard and sincerely to look forward to a stable retirement.
                        
                        I would urge the government and all relevant authorities to take prompt steps to improve the railways department.</p>
