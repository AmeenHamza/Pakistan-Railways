            According to the National Disaster Management Authority, the heavy floods have caused a loss of
            Rs.6.7billion to the railway network as several hundred kilometers of lines were washed away. The
            railwaycoaches w
            ere also the targets of angry mobs and arson attacks after Benazir Bhutto’s assassination
            resulting in huge losses. Out of 522 total engines only 220 are in working order, out of which 100 are
            inpoor condition. GhulamBalour, Federal Minister of Pakistan Railways, has not made any effort to hide
            hishelplessness over corruption affecting the department and the need for new locomotives.

                The addition into problems of railways began in January 2011 when a cheque for Rs700 million issued byPakistan Railways to Pakistan State Oil was not honored. The PSO subsequently stopped the supply offuel to Railways. According to a senior officer at Railways headquarters in Lahore some 30 freight trainshad to be stationed in yards near major railway stations across the country and only one freight train leftfor Muzaffargarh on Sunday. On an average, eight freight trains leave for Sindh for various destinationsdaily.Their are not enough funds for payment to PSO for high speed diesel to keep all freight trainsrunning. The Railways have also not received a single penny from the Rs11.1 billion package recentlyapproved by the cabinet.
              </p>
            <p>I am also confused that if people wants to obtain urgent ticket reservations, they will not get the emptyplace in any train, and even on our major holidays i.eEid- ul -Fitr, Eid- ul- Azha and Independence day ifyou want to travel then you must have an advance booking at least fifteen days or more, and the specialtrains are other then normal daily routine, innocent and poor people wait for the trains many many hoursmore then ten hours and sometime fifteen to twenty hours, and I have not seen any train to come at timein my twenty five years of life, six to seven hours train late is the normal routine in our country, why their isno accountability for them, are they not citizen of Pakistan? while if any air craft late for few minutes, itbecome the headlines of TV channels, although the journey taken by the eighty percent (backbone of the country) people of Pakistan, no one is consolidating at it, why this important institution of government isfacing deep financial riddleafter having colossal revenue and other conundrums, where the earnings ofthis organization are going, who is taking the compensation of this organization.
