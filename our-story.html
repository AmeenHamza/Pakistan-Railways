            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Among the means of transportation railways are the cheapest and safest mode for passengers andgoods. It also helps in growth of economy for the country. A plan for a rail system in Pakistan was firstproposed in 1858.A survey for railway line was initiated by Commissioner of Sindh ,Sir Henry EdwardFere in 1858. It was proposed that a railway line from Karachi City to Kotri, steam navigation from theIndus /Chenab up to Multan and from there another railway to Lahore and beyond be constructed. Thus,it was on 13th May, 1861 that first railway line was opened for public traffic between Karachi City andKotri, the distance of 105 miles. The line between Karachi City and Kemari was opened in 1889 and by1897 the line from Kemari to Kotri was doubled. 
            </p>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Since 1861 when the first railway line was laid down between Karachi and Kotri, the expansion of therailway network by the British came at a rapid pace up until 1947. The driving factors for this growth werestrategic and economic in nature. For instance to stop the invasion of the Russians from the West, theBritish built the Khojak tunnel, the fourth largest at that time, in seemingly inaccessible areas ofBalochistan to reach Chaman railway station. But after 1947, little has been done to expand and maintainthis network.
            </p>
            <p>The total length of railway tracks in Pakistan is 5,072 miles (8,163 km). and important railway routes anddetails of passenger train and freight in Pakistan are following : </p>

              The Freight Business Unit, with 12,000 personnel, operates over 200 freight stations on the railwaynetwork. The Unit serves the Ports of Karachi and Bin Qasim as well as all four provinces of the countryand generates revenue from the movement of agricultural, industrial and imported products such aspetroleum oil & lubricants (POL), wheat, coal, fertilizer, rock phosphate, cement and sugar. About 39% ofthe revenue is generated from the transportation of POL products, 19% from imported wheat, fertilizerand rock phosphate. The remaining 42% is earned from domestic traffic.

              The Freight Business Unit offers services to meet customer requirements and reduce costs throughefficiency, innovation and modernization. All possible efforts are made to increase revenues and pass onthe benefits to customers. The Freight Business Unit is headed by an additional General Manager.

            <h3>Lahore Railway Station (stands as it was built by the British)
            </h3>
            <p>ahore Railway Station, which is also known as the Lahore railway junction, is one of the oldest and busiest railway junctions in Pakistan. Dozens of passenger trains and cargo carriages make use of the Lahore junction station for large scale movements of the railway traffic. It is also the largest railway station in Pakistan in terms of area. In this blog, we’ll explore more about Lahore Junction and how it became one of the busiest railway junctions in Pakistan.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> The construction of the railway station in Lahore began during the colonial period. It was constructed right outside Walled City at the intersection of the current day’s Empress Road, Allama Iqbal Road, and Circular Road. Mian Mohammad Sultan Chughtai, a former official of the Mughal Empire from 1859 till 1860, constructed Lahore Railway Junction.</li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> The building of the railway station in Lahore boasts a medieval-style structure. It has thick walls, turrets, and giant holes all around it to direct gun and cannon fire to take necessary actions during the warfare. </li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> This unique structure of the Lahore train station is all because it was built in the post era of the 1857 war of independence. The station was designed keeping in view any potential future uprisings at that time. No doubt, the station is no less than a legacy of the massive railway network laid down during the British era. The railway station in Lahore is currently looked after and managed by Pakistan Railways. </li>

              PR is facing losses due to mismanagement, poor maintenance and weak ticket checks that allow peopleto get away with not paying for their tickets. There have also been political interventions in decision-making about which new routes to open. Furthermore, PR is not allowed to charge a market-clearingprice; fares have always been dictated by the federal government.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the National Disaster Management Authority, the heavy floods have caused a loss of Rs.6.7billion to the railway network as several hundred kilometers of lines were washed away. The railwaycoaches w
              ere also the targets of angry mobs and arson attacks after Benazir Bhutto’s assassination
              resulting in huge losses. Out of 522 total engines only 220 are in working order, out of which 100 are inpoor condition. GhulamBalour, Federal Minister of Pakistan Railways, has not made any effort to hide hishelplessness over corruption affecting the department and the need for new locomotives.
            </p>
            <p>The addition into problems of railways began in January 2011 when a cheque for Rs700 million issued byPakistan Railways to Pakistan State Oil was not honored. The PSO subsequently stopped the supply offuel to Railways. According to a senior officer at Railways headquarters in Lahore some 30 freight trainshad to be stationed in yards near major railway stations across the country and only one freight train leftfor Muzaffargarh on Sunday. On an average, eight freight trains leave for Sindh for various destinationsdaily.Their are not enough funds for payment to PSO for high speed diesel to keep all freight trainsrunning. The Railways have also not received a single penny from the Rs11.1 billion package recentlyapproved by the cabinet.</p>
